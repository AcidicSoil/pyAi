# Rule: Agent Reflection Loop

## Description
Each autonomous agent must include a reflection function to review its recent outputs and suggest re-attempts or delegation.

## Reason
Supports self-correction, quality improvement, and multi-agent collaboration.

## Implementation Notes
- Reflection should happen post-execution
- Must write insights to memory or include in `task_result.reflection_notes`
- Should evaluate whether task success criteria was met
