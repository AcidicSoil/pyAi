# Rule: Frontend Must Run First

## Description
The frontend (Vite + React + Tailwind + shadcn/ui) must always be initialized and served before backend or logic layers are developed.

## Reason
Ensures UI feedback loop is always active during development, preventing blind backend implementation and reducing debugging time.

## Enforcement
- All routes must be accessible via live dev server (`localhost:5173`)
- UI must stub out all known pages from `masterplan.md` and `stubout.md`
- Do not begin `fullycode.md` implementation if frontend fails to build
